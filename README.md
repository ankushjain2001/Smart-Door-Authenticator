# Smart Door Authenticator

A Smart Door Authentication system that sends alerts (via SMS and Email) to the house owner about any new or old visitor. It performs face recognition on a live streaming video of the doorway and issues an alert for different cases. It is a serverless microservice-driven web application hosted on AWS. It is built by utilizing the AWS services such as 
 - Kinesis Video Streams (Video Stream & Analysis)
 - Rekognition (Face detection)
